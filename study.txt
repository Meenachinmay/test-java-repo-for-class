Till now we have created a REST API. Which allows you store data about a user,
read the data, update the data and then delete the data.

But as of now there is no authentication is available.
What is Authentication?

Authentication comes into the place when you want to restrict the usage of your REST API.
When you want to decide that what should be the security of data on your server.

Backend is nothing but a platform to manage some kind of data for anything.

We need Authentication to provide data security.
IF you don't have authentication for your net banking, then anyone can use it and do what ever he wants to do.

You want that only you should be allowed to do so, that's where we need an authentication.

- There are many types of authentication available out there. ex JWT token based, Session Based, OAuth social auth flow
- We are doing JWT token based authentication.
